# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 14, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Worked through the rest of ES6 on FreeCodeCamp, Completed 1st exercise in Eloquent Javascript book, Chapter 2, Looping a triangle

**Thoughts:** I completed the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification in good time (3 months from end April to end July). I immediately started the Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification, but it's been slow going through the "Introduction to the ES6 Challenges". I'll need to revisit these but wanted to move forward for now, so I'm using this #100DaysofCode as motivation. Maybe it will click better when I come back to it in a while. Reading Eloquent Javascript seems to be helping solidy some things.

### Day 2: October 15, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: freeCodeCamp was down for a major update, so I finished reading Chapter 2 of Eloquent Javascript and did the final 2 exercises instead.

**Thoughts:** I immediately knew how to do these exercises (no Google needed, LOL), so I guess I have made some progress since I started trying to learn in earnest in April. I would like to re-visit the Chessboard at some point and make it scaleable.

2. [Chessboard](https://github.com/amygurski/EloquentJavascriptExercises/blob/master/Ch3-Chessboard/chessboard.js)

### Day 3: October 17, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: freeCodeCamp Regular Expressions tutorials & the first two Project Euler challenges.

**Thoughts:** freeCodeCamp is still down in that you can't log in to save your progress, but I'm saving my solutions to my Google Doc notes to add later. Regular expressions in JS was a new topic and intuitive. I also had some fun with Project Euler.

2. [Even Fibonacci Numbers](https://github.com/amygurski/ProjectEuler/blob/master/problem-2-even-fibonacci-numbers.js)

### Day 4: October 18, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: freeCodeCamp Regular Expressions  & "100 doors" Rosetta Code Challenge

**Thoughts:** Off to Cedar Point today. I have my laptop and hope to find an hour to code each day. 

**Link to work:** 
[100 Doors](https://github.com/amygurski/RosettaCode/blob/master/rosetta-code-100-doors.js)

### Day 5: October 19, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Finished freeCodeCamp Regular Expressions 

**Thoughts:** Did this from Cedar Point hotel. No exercises today outside of the freeCodeCamp challenges - it was easy enough to get away for an hour, but I want to get back to family who is visiting.

### Day 6: October 20, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Debugging in JS on freeCodecamp 

**Thoughts:** This section was all stuff I had figured out by now out of necessity, but it was still nice to have it laid out. No exercises today outside of the freeCodeCamp challenges - I'm back from the weekend at Cedar Point and tired.  

### Day 7: October 21, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Did the 1st project in the JavaScript Data structures and Algorithms certification on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I filled in my progress on freeCodeCamp then took a look at the 1st project. I decided I had done enough at this point to tackle it, so that was my focus today.

### Day 8: October 22, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Created my personal portfolio using Github pages and figured out how to link it to my domain.

**Thoughts:** I decided it would be good to have a shell of a personal page then add projects as I do them. But creating a webpage is a project in itself and I have been wanting to learn beyond HTML and CSS, so I'm not sure where I'm going to find the time.

**Link to work:** 
[My Personal Portfolio](amygurski.com)

### Day 9: October 23, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Personal portfolio, messed around with some HTML and CSS on my new site.

**Thoughts:** I got stuck in a rabbit hole of trying to make my new personal portfolio look a certain way instead of adding content or coding. It was disappointing. Tomorrow, I am going to get back to freeCodeCamp so I can finish JS this year.

[My Personal Portfolio](amygurski.com)

### Day 10: October 24, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 2nd project in the JavaScript Data structures and Algorithms certification on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I only have 107 challenges and 3 more projects to complete the JS track. OK, that sounds like a lot but there are 81 days left this year so I could do 2 challenges per day and still have 2 weeks to complete the 3 projects. Really, that seems more than do-able.

### Day 11: October 25, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Data structures in JS on freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** Good progress today on the Javascript section of freeCodeCamp even though there is no coding work to show for it.

### Day 12: October 26, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Finished data structures and started on Basic Algorithm Scripting in freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** Excited to be moving along. I was getting discracted by wanting to build my portfolio website and do projects but I feel like I'm learning and getting a better foundation by focusing on the JS curriculum.

### Day 14: October 28, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: getWITit Woman in Tech conference

**Thoughts:** Today was AWESOME. The most important part was probably networking, but as far as this challenge is concerned, I built a binary clock with a Raspberry Pi Zero and a small amount of Python exposure. And I went to a practice session for whiteboard interveiewing. I sat at the 0-1 year experience table and we had to "white board" reversing a string, counting a character in a string, and a multiplication table as a team.

### Day 15: October 29, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: HackerRank challenges

**Thoughts:** I signed up for HackerRank today to get more practice working out problems. I did the 1st day of 30 days of code and the 1st day of 10 days of JS and two Problem Solving challenges.

**Link to work:** 
[HackerRank Profile](https://www.hackerrank.com/amygurski)

### Day 16: October 30, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: SQL Murder Mystery Party

**Thoughts:** Super fun. I went to Tech Elevator for a walkthrough of SQL Murder Mystery and learned the basics of SQL.

**Link to exercise:** 
[The SQL Murder Mystery](http://mystery.knightlab.com/)

### Day 17: November 1, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Started Become a C# developer track on Lynda. Started learning about algorithms.

**Thoughts:** First introduction to algorithms and considerations like the Big O.

### Day 18: November 2, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Finished the algorithms topic. 

**Thoughts:** This was heavy on theory. Probably important but no exercises to show for it.

### Day 19: November 3, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: HackerRank - the first 5 days of the 30 days of code exercises.

**Thoughts:** I wanted to do some real exercises. These first 5 were easy at this point, but it did have a nice explanation of classes. If I can stay on top of them now, 1 unlocks per day.

### Day 20: November 4, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: HackerRank - the first 3 days of the 10 days of JS exercises.

**Thoughts:** This was 8 challenges in total. While the challenges were easy, the tutorials actually covered a lot of good basics that I'd missed or not internalized in freeCodeCamp.

**Link to exercise:** 
[HackerRank Profile](https://www.hackerrank.com/amygurski)

### Day 21: November 5, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: More HackerRank JS exercises.

**Thoughts:** I had fun getting the 2nd max of an array where the values weren't unique (eg. there might be 2 of the largest number).

**Link to exercise:** 
[HackerRank Profile](https://www.hackerrank.com/amygurski)

### Day 22: November 6, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Day 6 of Hackerank 30 days of Code and 2 more basic algorithm scripting challenges on fCC.

**Thoughts:**

### Day 23: November 7, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Attended React.JS meetup. Topic was Gatsby framework.

**Thoughts:** Most of this was over my head, but I was still happy I went.

### Day 24: November 9, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: freeCodeCamp JS - Finished the last 5 introduction to Algorithm Challenges and then did the 3rd final project - Caeser's Cipher

**Thoughts:** I wish I could remember syntax! I keep having to google to remember eg. the difference between slice and splice, etc.

### Day 25: November 10, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: freeCodeCamp JS - Finished the 4th project, which was a telephone number validator.

**Thoughts:** This was all about regular expressions. It's funny how long 1 line of code took to write (2 hours). I used VS Code to test it in bits. My result wasn't nearly as elegant as the solution, I didn't make use of '?' at all which would have reduced it by a lot. 

**Link to exercise:** 
[Tel Num Validator](https://github.com/amygurski/fCC-JS-Projects/blob/master/telephone-number-validator.js)

### Day 26: November 11, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: freeCodeCamp Object Oriented Programming

**Thoughts:** Completed 22/26 exercises. Felt like good progress. 

### Day 27: November 12, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Finished the last 4 Object Oriented Programming challenges and went back and finished the 11 or so ES6 challenges I had left. Spent some time trying to map out the cash register challenge. 

**Thoughts:** I'm a bit stuck on the cash register challenge. I wish I had someone to work with. I handled the easy cases of not enough cash in drawer and same cash in drawer and owed. But now I have to work out what change to give. I can kind of see how to do just the optimal change part using recursion starting from the largest denimination, but I also have to consider that I could for example run out of quarters and need to use 2 dimes and a nickel instead. And then what if I have enough in the drawer but can't break the correct change (eg. I have a $1 bill, but need to give $0.05 back). I was feeling stuck and took a break and finished up some of the freeCodeCamp curriculum instead.

### Day 28: November 13, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Finished last project for freeCodeCamp's JS certificate. Woo hoo!

**Thoughts:** A night to reset was EXACTLY what I needed to get unstuck on the cash register challenge. I'm sure it could be better, but I was really proud that I did it and it was my own solution and it worked. 

**Link to exercise:** 
[Cash register](https://github.com/amygurski/fCC-JS-Projects/blob/master/cash-register.js)

### Day 29: November 14, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Started Functional Programming in JS on fcc

**Thoughts:** I just have functional programming and advanced algorithms left on fcc before I claim my certificate. 600 coding hours under my belt which is awesome.

### Day 30: November 15, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: I had the morning off, so I spent a lot of time on Scrimba's intro to react course. 

**Thoughts:** So far I'm LOVING this course. It has a lot of repitition to help concepts sink in. 

### Day 31: November 16, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Finished functional programming and did the first Advanced Algorithm Challenge.

**Thoughts:** The advanced algorithm challenge was easy for me now and for once, my solution matched the given solution.

**Link to exercise:** 
[Sum All Numbers in Range](https://github.com/amygurski/fCC-JS-Projects/blob/master/Advanced-Algorithm-Scripting/sum-all-numbers-in-range.js)

### Day 32: November 17, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Advanced Algorithm Challenges on fCC.

**Thoughts:** I'm up to 7 out of 21 now. 

**Link to exercise:** 
[Advanced Algorithm Scripting](https://github.com/amygurski/fCC-JS-Projects/tree/master/Advanced-Algorithm-Scripting)

### Day 33: November 18, 2019

### Day 34: November 19, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Advanced Algorithm Challenges on fCC.

**Thoughts:** Woo hoow! I finished and claimed by Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures Certificate from freeCodeCamp. Another 300 hours of coding under my belt (and I believe it took that long for this one!).

### Day 35: November 23, 2019 
### Day 36: November 24, 2019 
**Today's Progress**: Scrimba's intro to react course. 

**Thoughts:** Not much to show for this. The playground is cool, so I feel like I am getting a lot of the concepts, but no projects to show for it. I'm about halfway through now. 

### Day 37: November 25, 2019 
**Today's Progress**: freeCodeCamp's front end libraries. Completed Bootstrap and jQuery.

**Thoughts:** Super fun, these challenges seem quick so I should hopefully get to the final projects in not too long.

### Day 38: November 26, 2019 
**Today's Progress**: freeCodeCamp's front end libraries. Completed Sass and started React.

**Thoughts:** Still fun. The React is familiar so far but getting close to new material.

### Day 39: Dec 1, 2019 
**Today's Progress**: Started the 1st front end libraries project on freeCodeCamp, a random quote generator.

**Thoughts:** Short break to spend time with family over Thanksgiving. I mostly finished the look of it and I love how it looks. I used Bootstrap and Font Awesome for the 1st time - I think I made it so the quote box will be centered horizontally regardless of the screen size.

### Day 40: Dec 2, 2019 
**Today's Progress**: Finished my random quote generator.

**Thoughts:** I learned a lot doing this. Used JQuery for the 1st time but I think it was also my first time combining JS with HTML & CSS.

**Link to exercise:** 
[Random Quote Generator](https://codepen.io/amygurski/pen/povzBVK)


### Day 41: Dec 4, 2019 
**Today's Progress**: Women, Wine, and Web Design

**Thoughts:** 2 hour introduction to HTML and CSS at Tech Elevator. We used Brackets this time, which is great. I would say discovering it was the best part. Also used JS a bit to Show/Hide a section.

**Link to exercise:** 
[Wine Cellar](https://github.com/amygurski/Women-Wine-and-Web-Design)

### Day 42: Dec 5, 2019 
**Today's Progress**: Personal Portfolio

**Thoughts:** I decided I can make my own portfolio page without using a theme. I was going back and forth on whether it would be better to just use a theme. I was surprised at how much progress I made in only about 2 hours. I only have 1 project I would even consider putting on it right now, but this way it'll be easy to add to it as I gain skills and do projects after I start my bootcamp.

**Link to exercise:** 
[Personal Portfolio](https://codepen.io/amygurski/pen/VwYLwWr)

### Day 43: Dec 6, 2019 
**Today's Progress**: freeCodeCamp's React

**Thoughts:** My bootcamp is going to use Vue rather than React. I think this may have been easier after learning Vue from what I have read. There are so many new concepts with components, props, state, etc. freeCodeCamp feels like kind of a quick overview, then I'm going to have to go back to Scrimba to cement the knowledge.  

**Link to exercise:** 
[fCC profile](https://www.freecodecamp.org/amygurski)

### Day 44: Dec 9, 2019 
**Today's Progress**: Learn C# in one day and learn it well.

**Thoughts:** This is a beginners book with a hands-on project at the end. I used my last vacation day to do the book. I got through half before lunch, but it was mostly review. The afternoon jumped straight into OOP concepts and has been much, much slower, so I won't finish today.

### Day 45: Dec 11, 2019 
**Today's Progress**: I received my pre-course work from Tech Elevator today!

**Thoughts:** I had already done all the freeCodeCamp and the one website project (tribute page). I submitted those and started reading the Little Book of Programming.

### Day 46: Dec 12, 2019 
**Today's Progress**: Introduction to Golang: Building a Cat Cafe API

**Thoughts:** Women Who Code Meetup. It was an introduction to building a REST API in Goolang for managing resident cats and reservations. I mostly followed along in the solution, rather than working out the code myself which was over my head, but I still had a great time.

[Goolang Cat Cafe](https://github.com/amygurski/golang-cat-cafe)

### Day 47: Dec 13, 2019 
**Today's Progress**: Tech Elevator course pre-work - Videos

**Thoughts:** I watched the 5 YouTube videos from Stanford CS101 on intro to computing principles, Bits & Bytes and Software 1 & 2. Practiced typing on typing.io.

### Day 48: Dec 14, 2019 
**Today's Progress**: Tech Elevator course pre-work -Algorithms on Khan Academy

**Thoughts:** I finished the first 2 sections that are required for the pre-work: Computing Algorithms and Binary Search Algorithm. I started on the next section and discovered there is something called "Big Theta" (I had heard of Big-O).

### Day 49: Dec 15, 2019 
**Today's Progress**: Tech Elevator Course pre-work - Git and CS50

**Thoughts:** Watched the 2 Git intro videos and set up my BitBucket account. I had started CS50 a few years ago, so I was able to transfer the 1st 2 solutions I had completed and modify them to pass the tests and re-submit them. It's a private repository.

### Day 50: Dec 16, 2019 
**Today's Progress**: Tech Elevator Course pre-work - CS50

**Thoughts:** Listened to the CS50 week 2 lecture (2 hours) on Algorithms. Listening to the 24 hours of CS50 lectures is optional, but I've pretty much done everything else so I feel like I should do it. On the other hand, I miss doing actual projects!

### Day 51: Dec 17, 2019 
**Today's Progress**: Tech Elevator Course pre-work - CS50

**Thoughts:** I completed problem set 2 for CS50 - Caeser and Vigenere. 

### Day 52: Dec 18, 2019 
**Today's Progress**: Tech Elevator Course pre-work - CS50

**Thoughts:** Listened to Lecture 3 and did the 1st problem from lecture 3, whodunit.

### Day 53: Dec 19, 2019 
**Today's Progress**: Cleveland C#/VB.Net User Group meetup - Building a Signal R App with React. Also started freeCodeCamp Data Visualization / D3.

**Thoughts:** The meetup was a 1 hour presentation / demo, rather than hands-on or workshop. I think exposure to everything I can is good this early on but didn't really take anything from it I could use / apply.

### Day 54: Dec 23, 2019 
**Today's Progress**: Tech Elevator Course pre-work - CS50

**Thoughts:** Back from Christmas with my family in Michigan. Listened to the first hour and a half of the CS50 lecture 3. 

### Day 55: Dec 27, 2019 
**Today's Progress**: fCC D3

**Thoughts:** So much fun.

### Day 56: Dec 27, 2019 
**Today's Progress**: fCC D3 

**Thoughts:** So much fun.

### Day 57: Dec 28, 2019 
**Today's Progress**: Finished fCC D3 and JSON APIs and AJAX.

**Thoughts:** Really enjoyed that section, but I looked at the first project and have no idea where to start.

### Day 58: Dec 30, 2019 
**Today's Progress**: Git and bitbucket

**Thoughts:** 1st day getting up at 6 and learning. Did a Git tutorial.
