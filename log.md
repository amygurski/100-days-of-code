# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 14, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Worked through the rest of ES6 on FreeCodeCamp, Completed 1st exercise in Eloquent Javascript book, Chapter 2, Looping a triangle

**Thoughts:** I completed the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification in good time (3 months from end April to end July). I immediately started the Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification, but it's been slow going through the "Introduction to the ES6 Challenges". I'll need to revisit these but wanted to move forward for now, so I'm using this #100DaysofCode as motivation. Maybe it will click better when I come back to it in a while. Reading Eloquent Javascript seems to be helping solidy some things.

### Day 2: October 15, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: freeCodeCamp was down for a major update, so I finished reading Chapter 2 of Eloquent Javascript and did the final 2 exercises instead.

**Thoughts:** I immediately knew how to do these exercises (no Google needed, LOL), so I guess I have made some progress since I started trying to learn in earnest in April. I would like to re-visit the Chessboard at some point and make it scaleable.

### Day 3: October 17, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: freeCodeCamp Regular Expressions tutorials & the first two Project Euler challenges.

**Thoughts:** freeCodeCamp is still down in that you can't log in to save your progress, but I'm saving my solutions to my Google Doc notes to add later. Regular expressions in JS was a new topic and intuitive. I also had some fun with Project Euler.

2. [Even Fibonacci Numbers](https://github.com/amygurski/ProjectEuler/blob/master/problem-2-even-fibonacci-numbers.js)

### Day 4: October 18, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: freeCodeCamp Regular Expressions  & "100 doors" Rosetta Code Challenge

**Thoughts:** Off to Cedar Point today. I have my laptop and hope to find an hour to code each day.

### Day 5: October 19, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Finished freeCodeCamp Regular Expressions 

**Thoughts:** Did this from Cedar Point hotel. No exercises today outside of the freeCodeCamp challenges - it was easy enough to get away for an hour, but I want to get back to family who is visiting.

### Day 6: October 20, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Debugging in JS on freeCodecamp 

**Thoughts:** This section was all stuff I had figured out by now out of necessity, but it was still nice to have it laid out. No exercises today outside of the freeCodeCamp challenges - I'm back from the weekend at Cedar Point and tired.  

### Day 7: October 21, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Did the 1st project in the JavaScript Data structures and Algorithms certification on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I filled in my progress on freeCodeCamp then took a look at the 1st project. I decided I had done enough at this point to tackle it, so that was my focus today.
