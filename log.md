# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 14, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Worked through the rest of ES6 on FreeCodeCamp, Completed 1st exercise in Eloquent Javascript book, Chapter 2, Looping a triangle

**Thoughts:** I completed the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification in good time (3 months from end April to end July). I immediately started the Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification, but it's been slow going through the "Introduction to the ES6 Challenges". I'll need to revisit these but wanted to move forward for now, so I'm using this #100DaysofCode as motivation. Maybe it will click better when I come back to it in a while. Reading Eloquent Javascript seems to be helping solidy some things.

### Day 2: October 15, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: freeCodeCamp was down for a major update, so I finished reading Chapter 2 of Eloquent Javascript and did the final 2 exercises instead.

**Thoughts:** I immediately knew how to do these exercises (no Google needed, LOL), so I guess I have made some progress since I started trying to learn in earnest in April.

### Day 3: October 17, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: freeCodeCamp Regular Expressions challenges

**Thoughts:** freeCodeCamp is still down in that you can't log in to save your progress, but I'm saving my solutions to my Google Doc notes to add later. Yesterday was a miss. I re-read the rules before I skipped it and confirmed that I can miss 1 day in 2 weeks. My youngest woke up a 4am (we ignored her until 5, but that was the end of sleep), I worked from 8-5, quick dinner with family, PTO meeting (I'm a treasurer), then monthly board game social with husband (whose New Year's resolution was to go to these more often). I'm not letting it get me down or stress me out. I know I can stick to the challenge and don't regret yesterday's priorities. Today was good - regular expressions were a new topic and intuitive.
